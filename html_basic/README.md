# My First Portfolio

This project is part of the ALX Front-End curriculum and serves as the foundation for building my personal web portfolio.

## Directory: `html_basic`

This folder contains the most basic and valid HTML structure, including:

- A `DOCTYPE` declaration
- Proper `<head>` and `<body>` sections
- A valid HTML5 structure that passes the W3C HTML Validator

### File: `base_index.html`

The `base_index.html` file includes:

- A clean HTML boilerplate
- Proper character encoding and viewport settings
- A title tag

This is the starting point for learning and building structured, accessible, and standards-compliant web pages.
